# Building a simple expected pass completion (xP) model using Keras

This repo contains the source code to acompany [my blog post](https://paulminogue.com/index.php/2021/07/03/building-a-simple-expected-pass-completion-xp-model-using-keras) on modelling pass completion probability using keras.

Feel free to use any of the code in this repo as a baseline or template for your own analysis!
